        <h2>A City of Parks
        </h2>
        <p>You don't need to go far to find a place to play in a park. You can hike 5 minutes from downtown, throw a frisbee in a fabulous field, or take your walk with your kids to the nearest play place. Whatever your goal,there is no shortage of parks to discover just minutes from home. Find a <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks">park</a> near you.

        <h3>Sports
        </h3>
        <p>If you haven't been to a Seahawks or Sounders game, stop right now and go. Of course, there's always The Mariners, too. There's plenty of alternative sporting events like minor league hockey and roller derby. Or, maybe you can test your own skills by joining a rec league of your own.
